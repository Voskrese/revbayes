## example
    # let's make up some taxa
    taxa = v("horse", "whale", "unicorn", "narwhal")
    # simulate a tree
    tau ~ dnUniformTimeTree(rootAge=1, taxa=taxa)
    # we also need a molecular substitution model
    molecular_model := fnJC(4)
    # together these form a continuous time Markov chain over the tree
    full_model ~ dnPhyloCTMC(tree=tau, Q=molecular_model, nSites = 100, type="DNA")
    # this will print a Nexus file with a simulated molecular matrix
    # to the working directory
    writeNexus(filename="test.nex", full_model)
